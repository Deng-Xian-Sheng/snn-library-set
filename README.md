# SNN Libraries Collection

[中文]{README_zh.md}|[English]{README.md}

This is a collection of SNN (Spiking Neural Network) libraries or frameworks.

The purpose of this collection is to provide a list for beginners as a reference when SNNs are just starting to become popular.

Below is the list of these libraries. You are welcome to submit a fork to add to this list.

- [SpikingJelly](https://github.com/fangwei123456/spikingjelly) is a framework based on PyTorch for deep learning using Spiking Neural Networks (SNN).

- [Lava](https://github.com/lava-nc/lava) is an open-source software framework for developing applications on neuromorphic hardware architectures.

- [snntorch](https://github.com/jeshraghian/snntorch) is a Python package for performing gradient-based learning with Spiking Neural Networks.

- [BrainCog](https://github.com/BrainCog-X/Brain-Cog) BrainCog is an open-source spiking neural network-based cognitive intelligence engine inspired by the brain for brain-inspired AI and brain simulation.
